//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



let Name=["Ahsan","Muneeb","Laraib"];
  for(var i of Name){

      console.log(`Hey! How are you ${i}`);
}
